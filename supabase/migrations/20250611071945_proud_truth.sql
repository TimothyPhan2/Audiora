/*
  # Drop profile_picture column from users table
  
  This migration removes the profile_picture column from the users table.
  The column can be added back later if needed for user avatars/profile images.
  
  ## Changes:
  - Remove profile_picture column from public.users table
  - No dependencies to handle (column not used in views/functions)
  
  ## Safety:
  - Column is not referenced in any views or functions
  - No foreign key constraints to consider
  - Safe to drop without CASCADE
